# GenAI4REtasks
Using GPT-3.5 Turbo, the classification script helps filter and prioritize requirements, while the traceability script establishes links between documents to track dependencies. It includes prompts that are carefully crafted using 5 different prompt patterns to communicate effectively with the model and provides generated results for each pattern.
